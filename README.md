# Income-Prediction-and-Customer-Segmentation-for-Targeted-Retail-Outreach

## Project Overview

This project develops data-driven methods to support targeted marketing outreach using U.S. Census income data. The objective is to help a retail organization identify high-income individuals and segment customers into meaningful groups for more efficient marketing strategies.

The project includes:

1. **Income Classification Model** – predicts whether an individual earns more than $50K annually.
2. **Customer Segmentation Model** – groups individuals into clusters using unsupervised learning techniques.

## Notebooks

The notebooks provide a step-by-step walkthrough of the project, including exploratory analysis, modeling decisions, and markdown explanations of the development process. They also contain experiments with alternative models that were evaluated before selecting the final approaches implemented in the scripts.


## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/micmich650/Income-Prediction-and-Customer-Segmentation-for-Targeted-Retail-Outreach.git
cd Income-Prediction-and-Customer-Segmentation-for-Targeted-Retail-Outreach
```
## Running the Project Pipeline

### Step 1 - Data Cleaning and Exploration

Creates the cleaned dataset used by downstream models
```bash
python scripts/data_cleaning_and_eda.py
```
Output:
data/processed/cleaned_dataset.csv

### Step 2 - Income Prediction Model

Trains and evaluates logistic regression classifier

```bash
python scripts/income_prediction_model.py
```
Outputs:

models/final_income_model.pkl
outputs/income_prediction_outputs/model_coefficients.csv

### Step 3 - Customer Segmentation

Generates customer clusters usibng PCA and MiniBatch K-Means

```bash
python scripts/segmentation_model.py
```
Outputs:

outputs/segmentation_outputs/cluster_labels.csv
outputs/segmentation_outputs/cluster_averages.csv
